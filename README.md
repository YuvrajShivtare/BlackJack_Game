**BlackJack Card Game in Python**

Blackjack is the American variant of a globally popular banking game known as Twenty-One. It is a comparing card game between one or more players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer. Players do not compete against each other. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:

- Blackjack starts with players making bets
- Dealer deals 2 cards to the players and two to himself (1 card face up, the other face down)
- All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture cards count as 10 and the ace can count as either 1 or 11. Card suits have no meaning in blackjack. The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand
- Players must decide whether to stand or hit
- The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through 21
- Players win when their hand totals higher than dealerâ€™s hand, or they have 21 or less when the dealer busts (i.e., exceeds 21)
